This code of conduct is written to guide an individual’s choices and actions within the free and open source software (FOSS) community. This code will help one determine the purpose and the course of his work as well as his place as a member of this community.

## 1. THE ETHIC OF RECIPROCITY

The most fundamental ethic is that of reciprocity–treat others as you would like others to treat you. Ask yourself if you are treating others in a manner that they would not treat you? If so, then your actions are out of bounds and you should cease those actions. Emotional reactions should be calculated carefully. Before acting, decide how the potential response might benefit you and/or the community and how it might hinder you and/or the community.

## 2. POLITICAL OR OTHER SORTS OF ACTIVISM

While there is certainly a political/activism element to the free software movement and open source software movement, political or any sorts of activism outside of the scope of those movements HAS NO PLACE in this community. The number one political agenda for any free and open source project should be the promotion of free and open source software. Any other political or promotional messages could distract or divert people from our primary mission. This is unacceptable! When you are here, you are contributing to this free and open source software. If you want to fight for causes like social justice or human rights, then you can join an organization whose primary goal is to fight for those causes.

## 3. ACTIONS DEFINE US

Do not judge others. People should not be prejudged because of their identity but rather evaluated on their accomplishments and actions. Harassment and discrimination should not and will not be tolerated. Instead, you be judged on your actions. And based on your actions, you will either succeed with your achievements or fail due to your incompetence or impotence.


## 4. ACCEPTANCE RATHER THAN TOLERANCE

Acceptance is expected among our members, but not necessarily tolerance. Tolerance is negative in connotation and in practice. Acceptance is a positive emotion and should be practiced by our members. Where tolerance focuses on the bad aspects of the person or situation, acceptance is seeing the good in the person or situation. So when you find yourself becoming irritated at the behavior of others, look deeper and find the positive aspects that are there within each of us.


## 5. VICTIM MENTALITY AND MARTYRDOM

Some people are habitual victims, seeking personal attention all the time. When someone is committed to being a victim, everyone else is to blame, Some victims prefer to play the role of martyr. They often pick fights in order to lose–to be the victim, to be the martyr. Martyrdom is often used by persons who cannot admit defeat or admit that they were wrong. If you are in a situation were martyrdom is your only course of action, then you are probably championing the wrong cause. Victim mentality and self-martyrdom will not be tolerated.

## ENFORCING THE CODE OF CONDUCT

The following actions are available to community leaders in the event that disciplinary action needs to be taken:

### 1. VERBAL WARNING
The verbal warning should be a private consultation from a community leader who should explain the violation and prescribe any corrective actions, such as a public or private apology.

### 2. WRITTEN WARNING
The written warning is a formal warning that should be part of the member’s permanent record. The written warning is appropriate if the member being disciplined has already received a verbal warning, or if the offense warrants skipping the verbal warning altogether.

### 3. TEMPORARY BAN
The temporary ban should be used for serious violations of the Code of Conduct. The member being disciplined is banned from any kind of interaction, public or private, with the community for a specified time.

### 4. PERMANENT BAN
A permanent ban is appropriate when the member being disciplined has proven that he cannot abide by the Code of Conduct. The member being disciplined is banned from any kind of interaction, public or private, with the community. This ban is permanent and irrevocable.
